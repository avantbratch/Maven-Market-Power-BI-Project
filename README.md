# Maven-Market-Power-BI-Project
Bonus Project created after  finishing Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence Online Course on Udemy.

This project is just a small part of Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence Online Course on Udemy. Throughout the course
I learned how to use Power BI to extract insights from data and communicate them effectively to stakeholders. The course covered a wide range of topics,
including data modeling, data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples,
